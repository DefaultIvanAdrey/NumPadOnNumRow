# NumPadOnNumRow
Basically, this is an accessible number pad on the number row for keyboards built without a numpad.  Made for those who use alt symbols, laptop users, and mechanical keyboard users who want to use the numpad easily.  I made this using AHK 2.0.

### Use your number row as a typical numpad, nothing special.

Don't worry, you can still use the special characters assigned to the number row accessible by the **Left Shift** button and **Right Shift** button.

The only issue is that unnecessary functions on the numpad like Home, End, PgUp, PgDn, ↑, ↓, →, and ← aren't accessible on the number row.

Unless you modify the .ahk file and create a version that uses another key from your keyboard, then assign it into a NumLock function, which I'm hesitant to release because I tried it, and I've got to be honest that it is kinda wack, it is useless, because I have those functions already in my keyboard, which I believe you guys also have. Here is a picture of my 87-key keyboard layout:

**TL; DR:** This version is ideally perfect for the main purpose of creating alt symbols.
